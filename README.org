* What is it

Small util starting a command in a separate (linux) filesystem namespace,
optionally creating a number of bindmounts in that namespace.

Not unlike the "untie" command.

The goal is to be small and simple to not to be too scary giving suid
root. But that doesn't mean it is fully secure.

* Compiling

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 $ make
 $ sudo make install
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 $ separate-ns --bind something=/tmp/myprivate-something --bind other=/tmp/x command arg arg
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Configuration

Valid mount points are configured using symlinks in /etc/separate-ns/. E.g to allow:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 $ separate-ns --bind foo=/tmp/x bash
#+END_EXAMPLE
there must be a symlink in /etc/separate-ns/ named foo, pointing to
the actual mountpoint. So if /etc/separate-ns/foo is a symlink to
/var/foo the command would run bash in a separate filesystem namespace
that has an extra bind mount at /var/foo pointing to /tmp/x
